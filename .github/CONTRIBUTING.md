## Useful Contributions

I welcome all issues or pull requests that address the following

1. Moving hardcoded personal details from `roles/` to `group_vars/`
1. New or improved documentation
1. Spelling, syntax, or other quality of life improvements
1. Help/Support questions (best effort)

## Other Contributions

If you have an idea that doesn't fit into one of the above categories it is probably best
implemented in your own fork of this repo. Some of these ideas include:

1. Adding or removing tools
1. Making things optional
1. Modifications for other operating systems
